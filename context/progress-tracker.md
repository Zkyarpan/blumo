- Dashboard placeholder (`/dashboard`) implemented with app shell, mission card, GitHub connection card, and progress card.
- Custom 404 not-found page created.
- Vitest configured with jsdom; 6 tests pass (wordmark, env validation).
- All scripts present: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `test:watch`.
- README updated with local commands and context folder link.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, `npm run build` all pass.

## In Progress

- None.

## Next Up

1. Unit 02: Supabase Auth — GitHub OAuth, session management, protected routes, middleware.

## Open Questions

- Final production product domain is not selected.
- Final logo mark is not selected.
- Dark mode is deferred; decide after the light MVP core flow is stable.
- Final Pollinations model and usage limit will be chosen during the AI provider unit.
- Private beta size and invite method will be defined before launch.

## Architecture Decisions

### Next.js App Router

Selected because the application needs a unified frontend and secure server-side integration boundary.

### Supabase Auth Plus GitHub App

Supabase owns the website session. The GitHub App owns selected-repository access. This keeps identity and repository permission concepts clear during the MVP.

### PostgreSQL with RLS

User-owned data is stored in Supabase PostgreSQL and isolated with Row Level Security.

### Manual Commit Approval

The first version never automatically publishes AI output. The user sees and approves the repository, branch, path, content, and commit message.

### Safe Repository Directory

The MVP writes only below `blumo/**`, reducing the risk of damaging an existing project.

### Provider-Neutral AI Interface

Pollinations is the first implementation, but feature code depends on an internal interface so the provider can be replaced later.

### Resend Subdomain

Email is sent from addresses below `mail.arpankarki.com.np`. The domain is verified. Supabase SMTP and product API keys still need to be created and configured.

## Session Notes

The project currently contains planning documents only. No application code, Supabase schema, GitHub App, or Vercel deployment has been created.

Begin with Unit 01. Do not start authentication or database work until the foundation unit is complete and verified.
